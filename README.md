# Real Estate Tokenization Platform

Imagine a platform that lets you invest in real estate by owning digital tokens, called NFTs, that represent a share of a property. These NFTs are deployed on the **Stacks (STX) blockchain**, which means they’re secure and easy to trade. Each property is divided into NFTs, and when you own one, you’re entitled to receive a portion of the rent collected from that property.

Here’s where it gets even more interesting: the entire system is managed through the **Internet Computer (ICP)**, which uses advanced technology called **Chain Key cryptography**. This means a smart contract—kind of like an automated digital agreement—controls the property and ensures rent is distributed fairly and transparently to NFT owners. So, instead of needing a traditional property manager, everything is done securely through the blockchain.

In short, it’s a way for people to invest in real estate, earn rental income, and trade their ownership shares all through a decentralized, easy-to-use platform.

## Tutorial: Real Estate Tokenization on STX Blockchain

This guide will walk you through the steps to create tokenized real estate properties using **Internet Identity**, **Internet Computer (ICP)**, and **Stacks (STX) blockchain**.

### Step 1: Login with Internet Identity
1. First, log in using your **Internet Identity (II)**. 
2. This action creates an STX wallet for you, generated using an **Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)** based on your ICP canister and principal ID.

### Step 2: Create a Property
1. Next, create a property on the **Internet Computer**. This step stores all necessary data about your real estate property in a canister smart contract.
2. The property data will be used to deploy an NFT smart contract on the **STX blockchain**.
3. When the property is created, an **STX wallet** is automatically generated for it. Fund this STX wallet to deploy the smart contract.
4. Once deployed, mint NFTs representing fractional ownership of the property. These NFTs will live on the STX blockchain.

### Step 3: Manage Your Property NFTs
1. After minting the NFTs, you can freely transfer them between **STX wallets** or to **ICP principal addresses**.
2. This setup allows for seamless transfer and ownership management of real estate assets across the STX blockchain.
